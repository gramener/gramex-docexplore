We retrospectively analyzed clinical data from 35 patients who underwent either PPSF or OPSF for thoracolumbar fractures, examining data at preoperative, 1-month postoperative, and 9-months postoperative time points, which included Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and regional kyphosis angle. We obtained preoperative and 9-month postoperative paraspinal muscle FI rates using T2-weighted MRI images and ImageJ software. We analyzed the correlation of FI rates with VAS, ODI, as well as the correction loss percentage of regional kyphosis angle. The analysis revealed a positive correlation between postoperative FI rate increase and correction loss percentage of regional kyphosis angle (r=0.696, p<0.001). The increase in paraspinal muscle FI rate was positively correlated with 9-month postoperative ODI (r=0.763, p<0.001). These findings indicate that an increase in postoperative paraspinal muscle FI rate may result in more significant correction loss of regional kyphosis angle and can lead to increased functional impairment in patients.",

      "para": "Different exogenous electric fields (EF) can guide cell migration, disrupt proliferation, and program cell development. Studies have shown that many of these processes were initiated at the cell membrane, but the mechanism has been unclear, especially for conventionally non-excitable cells. In this study, we focus on the electrostatic aspects of EF coupling with the cell membrane by eliminating Faradaic processes using dielectric-coated microelectrodes. Our data unveil a distinctive biphasic response of the ERK signaling pathway of epithelial cells (MCF10A) to alternate current (AC) EF. The ERK signal exhibits both inhibition and activation phases, with the former triggered by a lower threshold of AC EF, featuring a swifter peaking time and briefer refractory periods than the later-occurring activation phase, induced at a higher threshold. Interestingly, the biphasic ERK responses are sensitive to the waveform and timing of EF stimulation pulses, depicting the characteristics of electrostatic and dissipative interactions. Blocker tests and correlated changes of active Ras on the cell membrane with ERK signals indicated that both EGFR and Ras were involved in the rich ERK dynamics induced by EF. We propose that the frequency-dependent dielectric relaxation process could be an important mechanism to couple EF energy to the cell membrane region and modulate membrane protein-initiated signaling pathways, which can be further explored to precisely control cell behavior and fate with high temporal and spatial resolution.

      "para": "Since the end of the 19th century, socio-economic changes have greatly altered the Central European landscape and the structural and functional quality of habitats. Urban sprawl areas have appeared, a reduction of multiple forest uses has resulted in the densification of forests and agricultural land use has changed fundamentally through specialisation and intensification. Many of these changes affect biodiversity. To determine the important drivers of spatio-temporal dynamics of the population of 28 game species, we first considered a total of 130 potential explanatory variables. Second, we aggregated the main drivers of single-species models for habitat guilds. Third, we evaluated the results to aid in the development and implementation of mitigation measures for different ecoregions. We used harvest data as a surrogate for population density from 1875 to 2014 in South Tyrol, Italy. In generalised linear models, we used environmental characteristics such as climate, landscape diversity and structures, land cover, hunting, wildlife diseases, competition and predation, land-use type, and intensity (including pesticide use) as explanatory variables to predict the spatio-temporal dynamics of game species.\nThe important drivers are land use and management changes (intensification in the agriculturally favourable areas, extensification or abandonment in the unfavourable areas) as well as associated changes in the landscape features, diversity and structure, and hunting management. Climatic variables, interspecific competition and diseases only play a subordinate role. The dynamics of the habitat guilds and their drivers provide concrete indications for measures to maintain or improve the habitat quality for the investigated species. Particularly important are transfer payments to ensure extensive agricultural use, increasingly through the takeover of personnel costs, but also for the installation of an independent body that monitors and evaluates the effectiveness of the measures.\n",

      "para": "Background: Radiotherapy with deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) reduces doses to the lungs and organs at risk. The stability of breath holding and reproducibility of tumor location are higher during expiration than during inspiration; therefore, we developed an irradiation method combining DIBH and real-time tumor-tracking radiotherapy (RTRT) (DBRT).\nMethods: Nine patients were enrolled in this study. Fiducial markers were placed near tumors using bronchoscopy. Treatment planning computed tomography (CT) was performed thrice during DIBH, assisted by spirometer-based device. Each CT scan was fused using fiducial markers. Gross tumor volume (GTV) was contoured for each dataset and summed to create GTVsum; adding a 5-mm margin around GTVsum generated the planning target volume. The prescribed dose was mainly 42 Gy in four fractions. The treatment plan was created using DIBH CT (DBRT-plan), with a similar treatment plan created for expiratory CT for cases for which DBRT could not be performed (conv-plan). Vx defined as the volume of the lung received x Gy, and the mean lung dose, V20, V10, and V5 were evaluated. \nResults: DBRT was completed in all patients. Mean dose, V20, and V10 were significantly lower in the DBRT-plan than in the conv-plan (all p = 0.003). Mean rates of decrease for mean dose, V20, and V10 were 14.0%, 27.6%, and 19.1%, respectively. No significant difference was observed in V5.\nConclusions: We developed DBRT, a stereotactic body radiation therapy performed with the DIBH technique; it combines a spirometer-based breath-hold support system with an RTRT system. All patients who underwent DBRT completed the procedure without any technical or mechanical complications. This is a promising methodology that may significantly reduce lung doses.\n",

In order to understand the mechanisms responsible for sex chromosome turnover and the early stages of sex chromosome divergence, it is necessary to study lineages with recently evolved sex chromosomes. Here we examine sex chromosome evolution in a group of African cichlid fishes (tribe Tropheini) which began to diverge from one another less than 4 MYA. We have evidence for a previously unknown sex chromosome system, and preliminary indications of several additional systems not previously reported in this group. We find a high frequency of sex chromosome turnover and estimate a minimum of 14 turnovers in this tribe. We date the origin of the most common sex determining system in this tribe (XY-LG5/19) near the base of one of two major sub-clades of this tribe, about 3.4 MY ago. Finally, we observe variation in the size of one sex-determining region that suggests independent evolution of evolutionary strata in species with a shared sex-determination system. Our results illuminate the rapid rate of sex chromosome turnover in the tribe Tropheini and set the stage for further studies of the dynamics of sex chromosome evolution in this group. ",

In this study, CKD was utilized in the fabrication of one-mix geopolymer cement (GP) composite as an economical and environmental solution for disposal of this byproduct. The mechanical properties and durability behavior during various deterioration actions were inspected. The obtained findings demonstrated that, replacing slag by CKD in the fabricated GP could cause an elongation in the setting times and reduction in the compression strength of approximately 50%. However, GPs containing CKD offered an accepted resistance to irradiation by \u03b3- rays and to firing action. Reinforcing the GPs with nano Fe3O4 (NF) or nano TiO2 (NT) accelerated the geopolymerization reaction and offered mechanical properties surprising the control mix, This was related to the micro-filling and catalytic actions of the NPs which supported the formation of symmetrical and organized clusters of CSHs and CASH gel as shown in SEM micrographs. The reinforcing mixes surpassing the control mix in the protection against intrusion of sulfate ions which they could retain about 92% of their strength after 4 months of exposure while the control mix retained 80%. Furthermore, they showed a superior resistance to the destructive effect of irradiation by high dose gamma rays up to 1500 kGy and they retained ~ 75% of their strength after irradiation while the control mix was kept at only 35 %.

Immediately following their first chemotherapy cycle, participants wore a water-resistant pendant sensor for 14 days. This device tracked frailty markers like cadence (slowness), daily steps (inactivity), postural transitions (weakness), and metrics such as longest walk duration and energy expenditure (exhaustion). Participants were divided into resilient and non-resilient groups based on adverse events within six months post-chemotherapy, including dose reduction, treatment discontinuation, unplanned hospitalization, or death. A Chemotherapy-Resilience-Index (CRI) ranging from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate poorer resilience, was developed using regression analysis. It combined physical activity data with baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) assessments. The protocol showed a 97% feasibility rate, with sensor metrics effectively differentiating between groups as early as day 6 post-therapy. The CRI, calculated using data up to day 6 and baseline ECOG, significantly distinguished resilient (CRI = 0.2\u00b10.27) from non-resilient (CRI = 0.7\u00b10.26) groups (p<0.001, Cohen\u2019s d=1.67). This confirms the potential of remote monitoring systems in tracking post-chemotherapy functional capacity changes and aiding early non-resilience detection, subject to validation in larger studies.",

While the roles of microorganisms have been extensively studied, the significant contribution of various root exudates are still not very well understood. Through plant growth experiment, coupled with gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry methods, this study examined the effect of the presence of M. sativa on microbial-associated biochemical transformation of petroleum hydrocarbons. The results of this study revealed that the concentration of exudates within the soil matrix is a function of proximity to root surfaces. Similarly, biodegradation was found to correlate with distance from roots, ranging from \u226590% within the rhizosphere to <50% in bulk soil and unplanted control soil. Most importantly, for the first time in a study of an entire petroleum distillate, this study revealed a statistically significant negative correlation between root exudate concentration and residual total petroleum hydrocarbons. While not all the compounds that may influence biodegradation are derived from roots, the results of this study show that the presence of plant can significantly influence biodegradation of hydrocarbon pollutants through such root exudation as organic acids, amino acids, soluble sugars and terpenoids. Therefore, root exudates, including secondary metabolites, offer great prospects for biotechnological applications in the remediation of organic pollutants, including recalcitrant ones.",

Despite efforts to explore alternative energy sources, the world remains heavily dependent on crude petroleum oil and its derivatives. The expansion of the petroleum industry has significant implications for human and environmental well-being. Bioremediation, employing living microorganisms, presents a promising approach to mitigate the harmful effects of organic hydrocarbons derived from petroleum. This study aimed to isolate and purify local yeast strains from oil-contaminated marine water samples capable of aerobically degrading crude petroleum oils and utilizing them as sole carbon and energy sources. One yeast strain (isolate B) identified as Candida tropicalis demonstrated high potential for biodegrading petroleum oil in seawater. Physiological characterization revealed the strain's ability to thrive across a wide pH range (4-11) with optimal growth at pH 4, as well as tolerate salt concentrations ranging from 1-12%. The presence of glucose and yeast extract in the growth medium significantly enhanced the strain's biomass formation and biodegradation capacity. Scanning electron microscopy indicated that the yeast cell diameter varied based on the medium composition, further emphasizing the importance of organic nitrogenous sources for initial growth. Furthermore, the yeast strain exhibited remarkable capabilities in degrading various aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, with a notable preference for naphthalene and phenol at 500 and 1000 mg/l, naphthalene removal reached 97.4% and 98.6%, and phenol removal reached 79.48% and 52.79%, respectively. Optimization experiments using multi-factorial sequential designs highlighted the influential role of oil concentration on the bioremediation efficiency of Candida tropicalis strain B. Moreover, immobilized yeast cells on thin wood chips demonstrated enhanced crude oil degradation compared to thick wood chips, likely due to increased surface area for cell attachment. These findings contribute to our understanding of the potential of Candida tropicalis for petroleum oil bioremediation in marine environments, paving the way for sustainable approaches to address oil pollution.",

Despite the extensive studies to date, some of its physiological properties remain not fully understood. \nResults: This study demonstrated that the knallgas bacterium exhibited altered PHA production behaviors under slow-shaking condition, as compared to its usual aerobic condition. One of them was a notable increase in PHA accumulation, ranging from 3.0 to 4.5-fold in the mutants lacking of at least two NADPH-acetoacetyl-CoA reductases (PhaB1, PhaB3 and/or phaB2) when compared to their respective aerobic counterpart, suggesting the probable existence of (R)-3HB-CoA-providing route(s) independent on PhaBs. Interestingly, PHA production was still considerably high even with an excess nitrogen source under this regime. The present study further uncovered the conditional activation of native reverse \u03b2-oxidation (rBOX) allowing formation of (R)-3HHx-CoA, a crucial precursor for poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) [P(3HB-co-3HHx)], solely from glucose. This native rBOX led to the natural incorporation of 3.9 mol% 3HHx in a triple phaB-deleted mutant (\u2206phaB1\u2206phaB1\u2206phaB2-C2). Gene deletion experiments elucidated that the native rBOX was mediated by previously characterized (S)-3HB-CoA dehydrogenases (PaaH1/Had), \uf062-ketothiolase (BktB), (R)-2-enoyl-CoA hydratase (PhaJ4a), and unknown crotonase(s) and reductase(s) for crotonyl-CoA to butyryl-CoA conversion prior to elongation. The introduction of heterologous enzymes, crotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase (Ccr) and ethylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase (Emd) along with (R)-2-enoyl-CoA hydratase (PhaJ) aided the native rBOX, resulting in remarkably high 3HHx composition (up to 37.9 mol%) in the polyester chains under the low-aerated condition.\n\nConclusion: \nThese findings shed new light on the robust characteristics of Ralstonia eutropha H16 and have the potential for the development of new strategies for practical P(3HB-co-3HHx) copolyesters production from sugars under low-aerated conditions. \n",

Herein, we developed an optimized E. coli (BL21)-based system for the overproduction of soluble immunoreactive HCV core/envelope proteins that were utilized to establish a novel immunoassay for discrimination of active HCV infection. Methods: The core/E1-E2 genes were amplified and expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) in the absence/presence of glycylglycine. The antigenic performance of soluble proteins was assessed against 63 HCV-seronegative (Ab-) sera that included normal and interferent sera (HBV and/or chronic renal failure), and 383 HCV-seropositive (Ab+) samples that included viremic (chronic/relapsers) and recovered patients\u2019 sera. The color intensity (OD450) and S/Co values were estimated. Results: The integration of 0.1-0.4M glycylglycine in the growth media significantly enhanced the solubility/yield of recombinant core and envelope proteins by ~225 and 242 fold, respectively. This was reflected in their immunoreactivity and antigenic performance in the developed immunoassay, where the soluble core/E1/E2 antigen mixture showed 100% accuracy in identifying HCV viremic sera with a viral RNA load as low as 3800 IU/mL, without cross-reactivity against normal/interferent HCV-Ab-sera. The ideal S/Co threshold predicting active viremia (>2.75) showed an AUC value of 0.9362 (95% CI: 0.9132 to 0.9593), with 87.64, 91.23% sensitivity and specificity, and 94.14, 82.11% positive and negative predictive values, respectively. The different panels of samples assayed with our EIA showed a good concordance with the viral loads and also significant correlations with the golden standards of HCV diagnosis in viremic patients. The performance of the EIA was not affected by the immunocompromised conditions or HBV co-infection. Conclusion: the applicability of the proposed platform would extend beyond the reported approach, where glycylglycine, low inducer concentration and post-induction temperature, combined with the moderately-strong constitutive promoter enables the stable production of soluble/active proteins, even those with reported toxicity. Also, the newly developed immunoassay provides a cost-effective point-of-care diagnostic tool for active HCV viremia that could be useful in resource-limited settings.",

Apart from its well-elucidated metabolism, E. limosum is also genetically accessible, which makes it an interesting candidate to be an industrial biocatalyst. \nResults: In this study, we examined genomic, phylogenetic, and physiologic features of E. limosum and the closest related species E. callanderi as well as E. maltosivorans. We sequenced the genomes of the six Eubacterium strains \u2018FD\u2019 (DSM 3662T), \u2018Marburg\u2019 (DSM 3468), \u20182A\u2019 (DSM 2593), \u201811A\u2019 (DSM 2594), \u2018G14\u2019 (DSM 107592), and \u201832\u2019 (DSM 20517) and subsequently compared these with previously available genomes of the E. limosum type strain (DSM 20543T) as well as the strains \u2018B2\u2019, \u2018KIST612\u2019, \u2018YI\u2019 (DSM 105863T), and \u2018SA11\u2019. This comparison revealed a close relationship between all eleven Eubacterium strains, forming three distinct clades: E. limosum, E. callanderi, and E. maltosivorans. Moreover, we identified the gene clusters responsible for methanol utilization as well as genes mediating chain elongation in all analyzed strains. Subsequent growth experiments revealed that strains of all three clades can convert methanol and produce acetate, butyrate, and hexanoate via reverse \u03b2-oxidation. Additionally, we used a harmonized electroporation protocol and successfully transformed eight of these Eubacterium strains to enable recombinant plasmid-based expression of the gene encoding the fluorescence-activating and absorption shifting tag (FAST). Engineered Eubacterium strains were verified regarding their FAST-mediated fluorescence at a single-cell level using a flow cytometry approach. Eventually, strains \u2018FD\u2019 (DSM 3662T), \u20182A\u2019 (DSM 2593), \u201811A\u2019 (DSM 2594), and \u201832\u2019 (DSM 20517) were genetically engineered for the first time. \nConclusion: Strains of E. limosum, E. callanderi, and E. maltosivorans are outstanding candidates as biocatalysts for anaerobic C1-substrate conversion into valuable biocommodities. A large variety of strains is genetically accessible using a harmonized electroporation protocol, and FAST can serve as a reliable fluorescent reporter protein to characterize genetically engineered cells. In total eleven strains have been assigned to distinct clades, providing a clear and updated classification. Thus, the description of respective Eubacterium species has been emended, improved, aligned, and is requested to be implemented in respective databases.\n",

      "para": "Background \nSilk proteins have emerged as versatile biomaterials with unique chemical and physical properties, making them appealing for various applications. Among them, spider silk, known for its exceptional mechanical strength, has attracted considerable attention. Recombinant production of spider silk represents the most promising route towards its scaled production; however, challenges persist within the upstream optimization of host organisms, including toxicity and low yields. The high cost of downstream cell lysis and protein purification is an additional barrier preventing the widespread production and use of spider silk proteins. Gram-positive bacteria represent an attractive, but underexplored, microbial chassis that may enable a reduction in the cost and difficulty of recombinant silk production through attributes that include, superior secretory capabilities, frequent GRAS status, and previously established use in industry. \nResults\nIn this study, we explore the potential of gram-positive hosts by engineering the first production and secretion of recombinant spider silk in the Bacillus genus. Using an industrially relevant B. megaterium host, it was found that the Sec secretion pathway enables secretory production of silk, however, the choice of signal sequence plays a vital role in successful secretion. Attempts at increasing secreted titers revealed that multiple translation initiation sites in tandem do not significantly impact silk production levels, contrary to previous findings for other gram-positive hosts and recombinant proteins. Notwithstanding, targeted amino acid supplementation in minimal media was found to increase production by 135% relative to both rich media and unaltered minimal media, yielding secretory titers of approximately 100 mg/L in flask cultures.\nConclusion\nIt is hypothesized that the supplementation strategy addressed metabolic bottlenecks, specifically depletion of ATP and NADPH within the central metabolism, that were previously observed for an E. coli host producing the same recombinant silk construct. Furthermore, this study supports the hypothesis that secretion mitigates the toxicity of the produced silk protein on the host organism and enhances host performance in glucose-based minimal media. While promising, future research is warranted to understand metabolic changes more precisely in the Bacillus host system in response to silk production, optimize signal sequences and promoter strengths, investigate the mechanisms behind the effect of tandem translation initiation sites, and evaluate the performance of this system within a bioreactor.\n",

Yeast biomass with an appropriate composition and exposure of cell wall polysaccharides could constitute a functional feed additive in precision animal nutrition, naturally stimulating the immune system to fight infections. \nResults\nThe results of the research carried out in this study showed that the composition of Candida utilis ATCC 9950 yeast biomass differed depending on growth medium, considering especially the content of \u03b2-(1,3/1,6)-glucan, \u03b1-glucan, and trehalose. The highest \u03b2-(1,3/1,6)-glucan content was observed after cultivation in deproteinated potato juice water (DPJW) as a nitrogen source and glycerol as a carbon source. Isolation of the polysaccharide from yeast biomass confirmed the highest yield of \u03b2-(1,3/1,6)-glucan after cultivation in indicated medium. The differences in the susceptibility of \u03b2-(1,3)-glucan localized in cells to interaction with specific \u03b2-(1,3)-glucan antibody was noted depending on the culture conditions. The polymer in cells from the DPJW supplemented with glycerol and galactose were labelled with monoclonal antibodies with highest intensity, interestingly being less susceptible to such an interaction after cell multiplication in medium with glycerol as carbon source and yeast extract plus peptone as a nitrogen source. \nConclusions\nObtained results confirmed differences in the structure of the \u03b2-(1,3/1,6)-glucan polymers considering side-chain length and branching frequency, as well as in quantity of \u03b2-(1,3)- and \u03b2-(1,6)-chains, however, no visible relationship was observed between the structural characteristics of the isolated polymers and its susceptibility to immunolabeling in whole cells. Presumably, other outer surface components and molecules can mask, shield, protect, or hide epitopes from antibodies. \u03b2-(1,3)-Glucan was more intensely recognized by monoclonal antibody in cells with lower trehalose and glycogen content. This suggests the need to cultivate yeast biomass under appropriate conditions to fulfil possible therapeutic functions. However, our in vitro findings should be confirmed in further studies using tissue or animal models.\n",

In this study, we enabled the efficient metabolism of mcl-diols and -DCA in engineered Pseudomonas putida as a prerequisite for subsequent bio-upcycling. We identified the transcriptional regulator GcdR as target for enabling metabolism of uneven mcl-DCA such as pimelate, and uncovered amino acid substitutions that lead to an increased coupling between the heterologous \u03b2-oxidation of mcl-DCA and the native degradation of short-chain-length DCA. Adaptive laboratory evolution and subsequent reverse engineering unravelled two distinct pathways for mcl-diol metabolism in P. putida, namely via the hydroxy acid and subsequent native \u03b2-oxidation or via full oxidation to the dicarboxylic acid that is further metabolized by heterologous \u03b2-oxidation. Furthermore, we demonstrated the production of polyhydroxyalkanoates from mcl-diols and -DCA by a single strain combining all required metabolic features. Overall, this study provides a powerful platform strain for the bio-upcycling of complex plastic hydrolysates to polyhydroxyalkanoates and leads the path for future yield optimizations. ",

This study aims to assess brain activity, both within and between brain networks, following rifaximin treatment, considering the differences between response groups as well.\nMethods: Twenty-two healthy controls and 53 patients with cirrhosis (22 without and 31 with MHE, diagnosed by Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score, PHES) performed psychometric, attention and coordination tests, and blood inflammatory parameters were measured. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) acquisitions were performed on controls and MHE patients. Eighteen MHE patients underwent a rifaximin treatment for 6 months, after which all measures were repeated. fMRI images were analysed and changes after treatment were assessed.\nResults: After rifaximin treatment, 13 patients improved their PHES score (Responder patients) while 5 did not (Non-responder patients). No significant decrease in blood ammonia was observed after rifaximin treatment, but there was a decrease in plasma inflammatory cytokines in responder patients. A global effect of rifaximin was detected on the sensorimotor and fronto-parietal networks. Responder patients showed a relative increase of thalamic network connectivity in comparison to non-responder patients. Before treatment, responder and non-responder patients showed connectivity differences in basal ganglia network. The connection of the sensorimotor and thalamic networks between them and with other networks suffered changes after treatment. These connections between networks mostly decreased after treatment. All changes and differences showed a significant level of correlation with the performance of psychometric tests and the blood levels of inflammatory biomarkers. \nConclusions: There was an improvement of the communication between executive, motor and attention-related brain areas, and their functional independence following rifaximin treatment. Patients who respond also show a less deteriorated connection involved in these functions before treatment. Results suggest that the improved inflammatory state of MHE patients, following rifaximin treatment would favour the observed changes in brain function and enhanced cognitive performance.\n",

However, the specific impact of mitochondrial dynamics on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still under investigation. \nMethods: In this study, mitochondrial dynamic genes were obtained from the MitoCarta 3.0 database, and gene expression data were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Based on the expression of these dynamic genes and differentially expressed genes (DEGs), patients were stratified into two clusters. Subsequently, a prognostic model was constructed using univariate COX regression and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, and the prognostic signature was evaluated. We analyzed the interaction between these model genes and dynamic genes to identify hub genes and reveal mitochondrial status. Furthermore, we assessed immune infiltration, tumor mutational burden (TMB), tumor stemness indices (TSI), and the response to immune checkpoint block (ICB) therapy using the TIDE algorithm and risk scores. Additionally, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blotting (WB), and immunofluorescence (IF) were conducted to afford detailed visualization of the morphology of the mitochondria and the expression patterns of fission-associated proteins. \nResults: Patients in Cluster 2 exhibited heightened mitochondrial fission and had a worse prognosis. The up-regulated dynamic genes in Cluster 2 were identified as fission genes. GO/KEGG analyses reconfirmed the connection of Cluster 2 to augmented mitochondrial fission activities. Subsequently, a ten-gene prognostic signature based on the differentially expressed genes between the two clusters was generated, with all ten genes being up-regulated in the high-risk group. Moreover, the potential links between these ten signature genes and mitochondrial dynamics were explored, suggesting their involvement in mediating mitochondrial fission through interaction with MTFR2. Further investigation revealed that the high-risk group had an unfavorable prognosis, with a higher mutation frequency of TP53, increased immune checkpoint expression, a higher TIS score, and a lower TIDE score. The mitochondrial imbalance characterized by increased fission and upregulated MTFR2 and DNM1L expression was substantiated in both HCC specimens and cell lines. \nConclusions: In conclusion, we developed a novel MTFR2-related prognostic signature comprising ten mitochondrial dynamics genes. These genes play crucial roles in mitochondrial fission and have the potential to serve as important predictors and therapeutic targets for HCC.\n",

Nonetheless, current research on metabolic reprogramming in renal cell carcinoma mostly focuses on either tumor cells alone or conducts analyses of all cells within the tumor microenvironment as a mixture, thereby failing to precisely identify metabolic changes in different cell types within the tumor microenvironment.\nMethod: Gathering 9 major single-cell RNA sequencing databases of clear cell renal cell carcinoma, encompassing 195 samples. Spatial transcriptomics data were selected to conduct metabolic activity analysis with spatial localization. Developing scMet program to convert RNA-seq data into scRNA-seq data for downstream analysis.\nResult: Diverse cellular entities within the tumor microenvironment exhibit distinct infiltration preferences across varying histological grades and tissue origins.  Higher-grade tumors manifest pronounced immunosuppressive traits. The identification of tumor cells in the RNA splicing state reveals an association between the enrichment of this particular cellular population and an unfavorable prognostic outcome. The energy metabolism of CD8+ T cells is pivotal not only for their cytotoxic effector functions but also as a marker of impending cellular exhaustion. Sphingolipid metabolism evinces a correlation with diverse macrophage-specific traits, particularly M2 polarization. The tumor epicenter is characterized by heightened metabolic activity, prominently marked by elevated tricarboxylic acid cycle and glycolysis while the pericapsular milieu showcases a conspicuous enrichment of attributes associated with vasculogenesis, inflammatory responses, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The scMet facilitates the transformation of RNA sequencing datasets sourced from TCGA into scRNA sequencing data, maintaining a substantial degree of correlation.  \nConclusions: The tumor microenvironment of clear cell renal cell carcinoma demonstrates significant metabolic heterogeneity across various cell types and spatial dimensions. scMet exhibits a notable capability to transform RNA sequencing data into scRNA sequencing data with a high degree of correlation.\n",

We have previously identified mitochondrial Stomatin-like protein 2 (SLP-2), which functions in the assembly of respiratory chain proteins, as a Parkin-binding protein. Selective knockdown of either Parkin or SLP-2 led to reduced mitochondrial and neuronal function in neuronal cells and Drosophila, where a double knockdown led to a further worsening of Parkin-deficiency phenotypes. Here, we investigated the minimal Parkin region involved in the Parkin-SLP-2 interaction and explored the ability of Parkin-fragments and peptides from this minimal region to restore mitochondrial function.\nMethods: In fibroblasts, human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons, and neuroblastoma cells the interaction between Parkin and SLP-2 was investigated, and the Parkin domain responsible for the binding to SLP-2 was mapped. High resolution respirometry, immunofluorescence analysis and live imaging were used to analyze mitochondrial function.\nResults: Using a proximity ligation assay, we quantitatively assessed the Parkin-SLP-2 interaction in skin fibroblasts and hiPSC-derived neurons. When PD-associated PRKN mutations were present, we detected a significantly reduced interaction between the two proteins. We found a preferential binding of SLP-2 to the N-terminal part of Parkin, with a highest affinity for the RING0 domain. Computational modeling based on the crystal structure of Parkin protein predicted several potential binding sites for SLP-2 within the Parkin RING0 domain. Amongst these, three binding sites were observed to overlap with natural PD-causing missense mutations, which we demonstrated interfere substantially with the binding of Parkin to SLP-2. Finally, delivery of the isolated Parkin RING0 domain and a Parkin mini-peptide, conjugated to cell-permeant and mitochondrial transporters, rescued compromised mitochondrial function in Parkin-deficient neuroblastoma cells and hiPSC-derived neurons with endogenous, disease causing PRKN mutations.\nConclusions: These findings place further emphasis on the importance of the protein-protein interaction between Parkin and SLP-2 for the maintenance of optimal mitochondrial function. The possibility of restoring an abolished binding to SLP-2 by delivering the Parkin RING0 domain or the Parkin mini-peptide involved in this specific protein-protein interaction into cells might represent a novel organelle-specific therapeutic approach for correcting mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkin-linked PD.\n",

Fully quantitative pathomics features and collagen features were extracted from digital H&E images and multiphoton images of specimens, respectively. LASSO regression was utilized to develop the PCS.

CD4+T cells in overweight/obese CRC exhibited higher expression of immune checkpoint molecules. The antigen-presenting ability of DC and B cells is down-regulated in overweight/obese CRC, which may further aggravate the immunosuppression of overweight/obese CRC.

Moreover, the RGPRG score was found to be correlated with survival in 27 other cancers. In vitro experiments confirmed that knockdown of the key Rho GTPase-signaling biomarker SFN significantly inhibited HCC cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. \nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides new insight into the TME features and clinical use of Rho GTPase gene pattern at the bulk-seq and single-cell level, which may contribute to guiding personalized treatment and improving clinical outcome in HCC. \n",

In this study, we elucidated the molecular processes underlying the protective effect of Tirzepatide (TIR), a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor agonist (GIP-RA)/ GLP-1RA, against learning and memory disorders.\nMethods: We investigated the effects of TIR on markers of neuronal growth (CREB and BDNF), apoptosis (BAX/Bcl2 ratio) differentiation (pAkt, MAP2, GAP43, and AGBL4), and insulin resistance (GLUT1, GLUT4, GLUT3 and SORBS1) in a neuroblastoma cell line (SHSY5Y) exposed to normal and high glucose concentration. The potential role on DNA methylation of genes involved in neuroprotection and epigenetic modulators of neuronal growth (miRNA 34a), apoptosis (miRNA 212), and differentiation (miRNA 29c) was also investigated.

Due to the difficulty of early detection, most patients are diagnosed with advanced-stage disease or peritoneal metastasis. We found that LncRNA MEG3 is a novel tumor suppressor, but its role in tumor occurrence and development is still unclear. \n\nMethods: We investigated the expression level of MEG3 in pan-cancer through bioinformatics analysis, especially in gynecological tumors. Function assays were used to detect the effect of MEG3 on the malignant phenotype of ovarian cancer. RIP, RNA pull-down, MeRIP-qPCR, actinomycin D test were carried out to explore the m6A methylation-mediated regulation on MEG3. Luciferase reporter gene assay, PCR and Western blot were implemented to reveal the potential mechanism of MEG3. We further confirmed the influence of MEG3 on tumor growth in vivo by orthotopic xenograft models and IHC assay.\n\nResults: In this study, we discovered that MEG3 was downregulated in various cancers, with the most apparent downregulation in ovarian cancer. MEG3 inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of ovarian cancer cells. Overexpression of MEG3 suppressed the degradation of VASH1 by negatively regulating miR-885-5p, inhibiting the ovarian cancer malignant phenotype. Furthermore, we demonstrated that MEG3 was regulated at the posttranscriptional level. YTHDF2 facilitated MEG3 decay by recognizing METTL3\u2011mediated m6A modification. Compared with those injected with vector control cells, mice injected with MEG3 knockdown cells showed larger tumor volumes and faster growth rates. \n\nConclusion: We demonstrated that MEG3 is influenced by METTL3/YTHDF2 methylation and restrains ovarian cancer proliferation and metastasis by binding miR-885-5p to increase VASH1 expression. MEG3 is expected to become a therapeutic target for ovarian cancer.\n",

Immune suppression plays a significant role in the development of radioresistance. We have investigated the potential role of phosphatidylinositol transfer protein cytoplasmic 1 (PITPNC1) in regulating immune suppression associated with radioresistance.\n\nMethods: To elucidate the mechanisms by which PITPNC1 influences radioresistance, we established HT29, SW480, and MC38 radioresistant cell lines. The relationship between radioresistance and changes in the proportion of immune cells was verified through subcutaneous tumor models and flow cytometry. Changes in the expression levels of PITPNC1, FASN, and CD155 were determined using immunohistochemistry and western blotting techniques. The interplay between these proteins was investigated using immunofluorescence co-localization and immunoprecipitation assays. Additionally, siRNA and lentivirus-mediated gene knockdown or overexpression, as well as co-culture of tumor cells with PBMCs or CD8+ T cells and establishment of stable transgenic cell lines in vivo, were employed to validate the impact of the PITPNC1/FASN/CD155 pathway on CD8+ T cell immune function.\n\nResults: Under irradiation, the apoptosis rate and expression of apoptosis-related proteins in radioresistant colorectal cancer cell lines were significantly decreased, while the cell proliferation rate increased. In radioresistant tumor-bearing mice, the proportion of CD8+ T cells and IFN-\u03b3 production within immune cells decreased. Immunohistochemical analysis of human and animal tissue specimens resistant to radiotherapy showed a significant increase in the expression levels of PITPNC1, FASN, and CD155. Gene knockdown and rescue experiments demonstrated that PITPNC1 can regulate the expression of CD155 on the surface of tumor cells through FASN. In addition, co-culture experiments and in vivo tumor-bearing experiments have shown that silencing PITPNC1 can inhibit FASN/CD155, enhance CD8+ T cell immune function, promote colorectal cancer cell death, and ultimately reduce radioresistance in tumor-bearing models.\n\nConclusions: PITPNC1 regulates the expression of CD155 through FASN, inhibits CD8+ T cell immune function, and promotes radioresistance in rectal cancer.\n",

The purpose of this study was to elucidate the differences in the abundance, composition and biological function of intestinal flora in CRC patients with different BMI status.\nMethod: A total of 170 CRC patients were included and grouped according to the BMI data of CRC patients. BMI\u226524kg/m2 was defined as overweight group, and BMI within the range of 18.5-23.9kg/m2 was defined as normal weight group. Preoperative stool collection of patients in both groups was used for 16S rRNA sequencing. Total RNA was extracted from 17 CRC tumor tissue samples for transcriptome sequencing, and then CIBERSORT algorithm was used to convert the transcriptome data into the relative content matrix of 22 kinds of immune cells, and the correlation between different intestinal flora and immune cells and immune-related genes under different BMI states was analyzed. Finally, we identified BMI-related differential functional pathways and analyzed the correlation between these pathways and differential intestinal flora.\nResult: There was no significant difference in \u03b1 diversity and \u03b2 diversity analysis between overweight group and normal weight group. Partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) could divide the flora into two different clusters according to BMI stratification. A total of 33 BMI-related differential flora were identified by linear discriminant effect size analysis (LEfSe), among which Actinomyces, Desulfovibrio and Bacteroides were significantly enriched in overweight group. ko00514: Other types of O-glycan biosynthesis are significantly enriched in overweight group. There was a significant positive correlation between Clostridium IV and Macrophages M2 and T cells regulatory (Tregs). There was a significant negative correlation with Dendritic cells activated and T cells CD4 memory activated.\nConclusions: The richness and diversity of intestinal flora of CRC patients may be related to different BMI status, and the enrichment of Actinomyces, Desulphurvibrio and Bacteroides may be related to overweight status of CRC patients. The tumor microenvironment in which BMI-related differential flora resides has different immune landscapes, suggesting that some intestinal flora may affect the biological process of CRC by regulating immune cell infiltration and immune gene expression, but further experiments are needed to confirm this.\n",

This study aimed to construct and investigate the potential performance of a sub-regional radiomics model (SRRM) as a novel tumor biomarker in predicting the response of patients with NSCLC treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, and test whether its predictive performance is superior to that of conventional radiomics, tumor mutational burden (TMB) score and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression.\nMethods: We categorized 264 patients from retrospective databases of two centers into training (n=159) and validation (n=105) cohorts. Radiomic features were extracted from three sub-regions of the tumor region of interest using the K-means method. We extracted 1,896 features from each sub-region, resulting in 5,688 features per sample. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression method was used to select sub-regional radiomic features. The SRRM was constructed and validated using the support vector machine algorithm. We used next-generation sequencing to classify patients from the two cohorts into high TMB (\u226510 muts/Mb) and low TMB (<10 muts/Mb) groups; immunohistochemistry was performed to assess PD-L1 expression in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor sections, with high expression defined as \u226550% of tumor cells being positive. Associations between the SRRM and progression-free survival (PFS) and variant genes were assessed. \nResults: Eleven sub-regional radiomic features were employed to develop the SRRM. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) of the proposed SRRM were 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.84\uf02d0.96) and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.76\uf02d0.95) in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. The SRRM (low vs. high; cutoff value=0.936) was significantly associated with PFS in the training (hazard ratio [HR]=0.35 [0.24\uf02d0.50], P<0.001) and validation (HR=0.42 [0.26\uf02d0.67], P=0.001) cohorts. A significant correlation between the SRRM and three variant genes (H3C4, PAX5, and EGFR) was observed.

An increase in drawdown pressure and/or a decrease in reservoir pressure increases the sand production rate. Since the problem of sand production is one of the main issues in the Asmari sandstone formation located in one of the oilfields in the southwest of Iran, therefore, in this research, the variations in the sand production rate due to the changes in the reservoir and drawdown pressures were investigated. So, for the first time, a hybrid numerical model of finite difference method (FDM) - discrete element method (DEM) - finite element method (FEM) - computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was developed. This numerical model investigated the increase in the sand production rate due to variations in reservoir pressure with a constant bottom-hole flowing pressure. Then, by performing an extensive sensitivity analysis on different values of reservoir pressure and drawdown pressure, the changes in the sanding rate, the critical drawdown pressure, and the safe drawdown line were determined. The results showed that, if the production flow rate of the well is constant, increasing the drawdown pressure can change the sand production rate only to a certain extent, and more than that, will be produced at a constant rate. Also, adjusting the drawdown pressure within a safe range does not necessarily keep the sand production rate constant at a permissible value for a long time, while by keeping the bottom hole flowing pressure constant within an acceptable range, the sand production rate can be controlled for a longer period.",

In general, the most common means of revealing hydraulic fracture propagation rules are laboratory hydraulic fracture physical simulation experiments and numerical simulation. However, the former is difficult to meet the real shale reservoir environment, and the latter research focuses mostly on fracturing technology and the interaction mechanism between hydraulic fractures and natural fractures, both of which do not consider the influence of temperature effect on hydraulic fracture propagation. In this paper, the hydraulic fracturing process is divided into two stages (thermal shock and hydraulic fracture propagation). Based on the cohesive zone method, a coupled simulation method for sequential fracturing of deep shale is proposed. The effects of different temperatures, thermal shock rates, and times on the scale of thermal fractures are analyzed. As well as the effects of horizontal stress difference and pumping displacement on the propagation rule of hydraulic fractures. The results show that the temperature difference and the thermal shock times determine the size and density of thermal fractures in the surrounding rock of the borehole, and the number of thermal fractures increases by 96.5% with the increase of temperature difference. Thermal fractures dominate the initiation direction and propagation path of hydraulic fractures. The main hydraulic fracture width can be increased by 150% and the length can be increased by 46.3% by increasing the displacement; the secondary fracture length can be increased by 148.7% by increasing the thermal shock times.

However, existing common waterflooding prediction models often rely on assumptions that may not apply universally or lack theoretical derivation through statistical analysis. This has led to unsatisfactory prediction accuracy and multiple potential solutions. To address these limitations, it is proposed to incorporate the oil/water relative permeability ratio model into the derivation process of waterflooding prediction models. Initially, an evaluation of prevalent oil/water relative permeability ratio models is conducted, along with an analysis of their primary constraints. Additionally, the applicability of the analytical relative permeability model is thoroughly examined. Building upon the analytical relative permeability model and a modified Welge equation, a new waterflooding model is formulated, encompassing all pertinent physical coefficients. Notably, this model aligns seamlessly with the commonly used Arps\u2019 decline curve, while extending its applicability to a broader range of conditions. Moreover, it can be simplified to generate typical water drive curves under suitable circumstances. The semi-log relationship between oil/water relative permeability ratio and water saturation is further simplified into a linear relationship or a multi-term formula. Compared with the traditional waterflooding model, the new model proposed in this research has a wider application range and can be applied to oilfield at high water cut. At the same time, the new model clarifies the coefficient of waterflooding curve A and the physical meaning of parameter 7.5 in Tong's chart method for the first time.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is the most advanced technique for determining S_wirr. While highly accurate, the NMR-based method necessitates the laboratory measurement of the transverse relaxation time (T_2 ) cutoff. Lab-based T_2 cutoff determination is resource-intensive and time-consuming.

Subsequently, the data points (T_2,S_bw ) were graphed on a scatter plot to unveil the relationship between S_bw and T_2. The scatter plot illustrates an exponential decrease in S_bw with increasing T_2, forming the basis for the S_wirr model derived from this relationship. Finally, the parameters of the S_wirr model were fine-tuned using SCAL tests.

Besides, most of the investigations had focused on crude oil which is a complex mixture of thousands of components making it hard to extract any reliable conclusions with respect to the crude oil type So, the current study is focused on the application of ionic liquids (ILs) from different families of pyridinium and imidazolium, titanium oxide nanoparticles, and salts (MgCl2 and CaCl2) in the presence of resinous synthetic oil for the first time. The obtained results using the central composite design (CCD) approach revealed the positive effect of resin fraction on the IFT reduction by 27% considering the initial value (34.9%). Using the CCD approach revealed that using pH = 7, MgCl2 concentration = 21000 ppm, CaCl2 concentration = 21000 ppm, resin fraction of 9wt%t and 500 ppm of [C12mim][Cl] concentration reduces the IFT to minimum value of 0.62 mN/m while the minimum IFT value for optimum conditions of solution includes [C12py][Cl] led to minimum IFT value of  2.2 mN/m. But, the contact angle (CA) measurements revealed better synergy between [C12py][Cl] and TiO2-NPs (0-200 ppm) for better wettability alteration toward water-wet condition (27.3o) than [C12mim][Cl] (33.2o). Moreover, the IFT measurements revealed that the presence of TiO2-NPs is effective in reducing the IFT of the optimum formulations to 0.55 and 0.84 mN/m for [C12mim][Cl], and [C12py][Cl], respectively. According to the results, it seems that the obtained optimum formulations for [C12mim][Cl], and [C12py][Cl] are applicable for EOR purposes as new hybrid solutions. ",

Based on many core and thin section observations, as well as statistical analyses of sandstone thickness and percentage of sandstone content from 1446 wells, we analyzed the coastal changes and control factors of the microfacies type, planar morphology and distribution of the Benxi Fm sandbodies in the field. The results indicate that the Benxi Fm of the Yanchang gas field is generally composed of terrigenous coastal clastic barrier deposits in a medium to small tidal range environment, but the wave action in the southern region is weak, forming typical barrier sandbars and backbarrier deposits. The wave actions in the north change more strongly, forming three major microfacies sandbodies: reworked barriers, shoals, and incised-valley-filled tidal channels. The barrier sandbodies are arranged in a belt or bead-like pattern parallel to the shoreline and are distributed longshore near the provenance. The oval-shaped shoal sandbodies are dispersed further from the shoreline, and the filling of tidal channel sandbodies is controlled by ancient geomorphic grooves. This research has important guiding significance for the identification and evaluation of reservoirs in the Yanchang gas field and similar geological settings.",

Natural fractures will be demaged by the induced stress, the induced stress field produced by natural fracture damage will in turn affect the propagation of hydraulic fractures. Previous studies usually ignored the the impact of stress field variation caused by natural fracture damage, leading to inaccurate fracture propagation simulation results. A new model for simulating hydraulic fracturing induced stress field is established with consideration of the influence of natural fracture damage. Then, the natural-fracture-induced stress is analyzed in open and closed fracture states.  Through superposition of stress fields of natural fractures and hydraulic fractures, the interaction among open and closed natural fractures, reservoir, and hydraulic fracture, and the corresponding fracture property evolution are studied. The results demonstrate that induced stress is not affected by elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of the rock. The induced stress difference at the fracture tip is proportional to the net pressure and the length of hydraulic fractures. The results provide guidance for the optimal design of fracturing. When the deflection angle of hydraulic fracture is less than 90\u00b0, the maximum induced stress difference at the fracture tip decreases with the reduction of deflection angle. When the deflection angle of hydraulic fracture is smaller than 90\u00b0 or the deflection angle of natural fracture is smaller than 45\u00b0, the steering of hydraulic fracture is less hindered, which is beneficial to the formation of complex fracture network.

The incorporation of EM absorbers, particularly nanoparticles, has demonstrated significant potential to boost efficiency and expand the stimulated reservoir volume. However, the application of simultaneous EM radiation and nanofluid injection in a natural porous medium, which is critical for the successful implementation of this approach in field-scale operations, remains an underexplored frontier. In this context, this research represents a pioneering endeavor, aiming to bridge this knowledge gap through a comprehensive statistical and optimization study. The primary objective was to unravel the intricate interplay between five distinct types of magnetic nanoparticles and their concentrations within the base fluid to improve oil production. Notably, it focused on iron oxide (Fe3O4) magnetic nanoparticles and their innovative hybridization with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), and nickel oxide (NiO) nanomaterial. A newly designed glass sandpack were employed as the porous medium, thus mirroring real reservoir conditions more accurately. Then, a rigorous full factorial design scrutinized the multifaceted effects of nanoparticle type and concentration when introduced into deionized (DI) water during this process. Results showed that microwave radiation, applied at 400 watts, dramatically improved oil recovery, catapulting it from a baseline of 19% to an impressive 39.5% during water injection. The addition of magnetic nanoparticles to the base fluid enhances efficiency. However, the specific type of nanoparticle exerts varying effects on oil recovery rates. Notably, the synthesis of Fe3O4-MWCNT nanoparticles had a substantial impact on the ultimate oil recovery factor, achieving approximately 69%. Furthermore, the hybridization of Fe3O4 nanoparticles with MWCNT and NiO nanoparticles leads to reduced consumption (using low weight percentages) while achieving the highest oil recovery rates during the injection process. Finally, the optimization analysis demonstrated that employing 0.34 wt. % of Fe3O4-MWCNT nanoparticles under 400 watts of microwave radiation represents the optimal condition for achieving the highest oil production in a sandpack porous medium. Under these conditions, the oil recovery factor can increase to 78%.",

Therefore, a numerical systematic approach was provided to predict sand production in wellbore SDX-5, drilled in a deep-water sandstone reservoir in the Shah-Deniz gas field (South Caspian Basin), which has never been done previously. Additionally, this systematic approach uses geomechanical and geodynamical criteria, along with petrophysical information (density and sonic log) and tectonic characteristics of the study area, which are influenced by the active tectonic stresses of the Apsheron-Balkhan zone.

The computations conducted achieved azimuth, inclination, polar, and depth profile plots for the Lower Balakhany Formation. The calculations reveal that the optimum azimuth for the wellbore drilling trajectories is parallel to SHmax and oblique drilling to near horizontal is the result of optimum inclination. Polar plots showed optimum azimuth, inclination, and effect of wellbore trajectory on critical collapse pressure and collapse drawdown pressure with pressure values simultaneously, which identify safer alternatives for achieving higher petroleum production rates without sanding. Depth profile plots provide a simultaneous overview of the values of critical collapse pressure, critical sanding pressure for instantaneous drawdown, and optimum wellbore production pressure during drilling and production operations.

However, this technique is mainly used at low water cut stage. Research on this technique at high water cut stage is comparatively few. Therefore, in order to improve productivity and recovery of wells, feasibility analysis of commingle production of multi-layer reservoirs in the high water cut stage is analyzed. To achieve a good commingle production result, the production layers must be optimized and interlayer interference must be analyzed and reduced as much as possible. Factors such as permeability, porosity, viscosity, capillary pressure, gravity, pressure difference, and water cut difference have impact on commingle production. But it is difficult to consider all these factors. Therefore, according to the geological reservoir characteristics of X Oilfield, a model is established to simulate commingle production process, and the results are compared and analyzed. The interference degree is characterized by seepage resistance. The commingle production effect is evaluated by dimensionless oil increase coefficient, production index, and production index interference coefficient. The results show that the larger the difference of permeability ratio and water cut between multi-layers, the more severe the interlayer interference; dimensionless oil increase coefficients are all positive, it means that commingle production can achieve good oil increase effect even in the high water cut stage; the recommended technical limits for commingle production are that: permeability ratio is less than 5; commingle production timing is that water cut of low permeability layer is higher than 80%. This technique has been applied to X Oilfield, and the oil recovery increased about 2.8%, which confirmed this method feasibility.",

Considering the use of highly toxic chrome-based deflocculant in the industry, Rhizophora spp. tannin-lignosulfonate (RTLS) was synthesized in this study as an alternative deflocculant. A viscometer was used to study the rheological properties, and the filtration performance was evaluated using low-pressure low-temperature (LPLT) and high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) filter press in accordance with The American Petroleum Institute (API) standard procedure. The addition of 0.5 wt% RTLS to water-based drilling fluid (WBDF) was effective in a significant reduction of the plastic viscosity (PV) and yield point (YP) of WBDF at elevated temperatures. As the amount of RTLS added to the suspension exceeds 0.5 wt%, the effect on PV and YP becomes negligible. A higher fluid loss of 13 mL was observed in the WBDF without RTLS aged at 177 \u00b0C. The addition of 2.0 wt% RTLS reduced the fluid loss to 10.7 mL. This suggests that RTLS is an effective deflocculant that can be used to improve the filtration properties of WBDF at high temperatures. The morphology of RTLS filter cakes was examined using field emission scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (FESEM-EDX). The interlayer between clay particles was identified as RTLS, a natural additive that plays a vital role in enhancing filtration while minimizing fluid loss. The outcomes of this research are promising, and this non-toxic deflocculant has the potential to replace chrome-based deflocculants that are still in use for borehole drilling.",

Conventional separation techniques using demulsifiers for separation of oil-water mixtures or even use of membranes usually suffered from high cost and energy consumption, composition dependency of demulsifiers and fouling or inability of a single membrane to separate all types of oil\u2013water mixtures. This research aimed to synthesize tungsten oxide-coated stainless-steel mesh using the hydrothermal method, with a focus on evaluating its effectiveness in oil-water separation. The coating procedure was carried out using hydrothermal techniques, with an emphasis on investigating the impact of precursor concentration, pH levels, reaction temperature and duration, on the separation efficiency of the optimal coating solution. The hydrothermally coated stainless steel mesh was created within a polytetrafluoroethylene reaction vessel, submerged in a 150 ml aqueous solution containing 0.0094 moles of sodium tungstate dihydrate at pH 3.0, achieved through the addition of hydrochloric acid. Additionally, 1 gram of oxalic acid, acting as a chelating agent, was introduced. Subsequently, the mesh underwent a 4-hour reaction at 220\u00b0C and was subsequently annealed for 30 minutes in a 350\u00b0C furnace. Remarkably, the resultant mesh exhibited an exceptional water separation flux of 9870\u00b115 L/hr/m\u00b2 when exposed to 1:1 v/v oil-water mixtures. This performance significantly outperformed previous filters designed for similar oil-water separation tasks. The mesh efficiently facilitated the passage of water through the oil-water mixture, achieving an efficiency rate exceeding 98\u00b11%. To gauge its wetting behavior, the hydrophilic/underwater oleophobic filter underwent static contact angle measurements. The filter's wetting mechanism was primarily attributed to its hierarchical surface structure, which enhanced surface hydrophilicity and roughness. Analytical techniques such as XRD, FTIR, and FE-SEM were employed to scrutinize the fabricated filter's composition. These analyses confirmed the successful creation of a nanostructured WO3 coating on both sides of the stainless steel mesh. Moreover, the utilization of commercially available chemicals and straightforward fabrication techniques underscores the promising potential of this approach for large-scale applications.",

The critical productivity of horizontal wells in a bottom water reservoir with an interlayer can be evaluated more accurately. Firstly, the three-dimensional seepage field is approximately decomposed into internal and external seepage fields, and the critical productivity formulas of internal and external seepage fields are solved, respectively. Using the equivalent seepage resistance, the critical productivity formula of horizontal wells in interlayer-bottom water reservoirs is obtained. The results are compared with the calculation results of the traditional productivity formula and the simulation results of the commercial software ECLIPSE. Second, based on the mass conservation principle and momentum conservation principle, the wellbore-reservoir coupling mathematical model of a horizontal well is established by the discrete method. Finally, the sensitivity analysis of the selected parameters is discussed in detail. The results show that: (1) Compared with the traditional productivity algorithm, the algorithm considers the influence of interlayers on productivity and gives a detailed theory, a specific calculation process, and the importance of accurate prediction of wellbore flow.

Bio-oil shares characteristics with traditional binders used in asphalt, resulting in three main applications: bio-asphalt, bio-rejuvenator, and polyurethane (PU)-modified bio-asphalt. Bio-asphalts, though similar to traditional binders, display vulnerability to aging, experiencing mass loss and volatile component evaporation when aged. Bio-oil incorporation affects high and low-temperature performance grades adversely, limiting its usage due to susceptibility to aging and impact on high-temperature performance.\nTo tackle these issues, additives like rejuvenators, polymers, nanomaterials, and crumb rubber have been introduced to enhance aging resistance and overall performance of bio-asphalt.

The lower band gap value of ~1.82 eV with ECB and EVB value of 0.48 eV and 2.3 eV is in good agreement with the reported low band gap semiconductors for the degradation of various pollutants. The synthesized FOX-MS was efficiently degrading ~63% at 10 mgL-1 of TC. Interestingly, Fenton activity of FOX-MS-based photocatalytic materials improved the TC degradation and achieved maximum degradation of ~94% at 10 mgL-1 of TC antibiotics. The degradation of TC antibiotics was also performed under acidic and basic pH conditions to confirm the mechanistic pattern of degradation of TC using FeOI based metallic microsponge. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the synthesis of FeOI metallic microsponge using a hydrothermal process.",

This research paper employs the metaphor of fitting puzzle pieces together to delve into the complexities of the market. It highlights the central puzzle piece that often goes unnoticed: the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. The lack of compatibility in LCA methodologies across certifications creates significant hurdles in achieving harmonization of crucial aspects such as governance, hydrogen categorization, emissions threshold determination, segmented certification due to various hydrogen end-uses, and chain-of-custody tracking systems that catches the interest of research so far.  To address this oversight, the paper adopts a structured approach to accomplish its objectives. Firstly, it thoroughly investigates the existing life cycle methodologies employed in global hydrogen schemes, treating them as distinct puzzle pieces. This analysis delves into key components of these methodologies, including eligible sources and pathways, functional unit determination, system boundary definition, cut-off rules, allocation choices, and impact assessment.

In this paper, a new decision-making method is presented in a way that tries to evaluate options more accurately by considering the possibility of changing the criteria's desirability in different ranges. It is not always appropriate to increase\\decrease a positive\\negative criterion. Even in some situations, crossing a certain limit can reduce the desirability of the desired criterion.

However, the negative impact of HCHO mentioned above is often overlooked because of its low concentration. In this study, the CuO/ZnO-AlN catalyst was synthesized using a simple deposition precipitation method. The catalyst demonstrated a high removal rate of HCHO and inhibition of FA, along with excellent hydrothermal stability. Aluminum nitride (AlN) can form a layer of Al(OH)3 coating, acting as a physical barrier against H2O during the reaction process and releasing trace OH- to facilitate the formation of Cannizaro intermediates. It can then catalyze HCHO dehydrogenation under alkaline-free conditions to form H2 and an intermediate (HCOO-), which is further converted to H2 and CO2 under the influence of Cu0. The relevant characterization results showed that Cu0 is the active site. The strong interaction between AlN and copper refines the particle size of CuO and promotes the reduction of CuO to Cu0. In addition, an H2 atmosphere can more effectively inhibit the oxidation of Cu0 compared to an N2 atmosphere, resulting in a higher HCHO removal rate. This rate can reach 100% at 105\u2103 and 4 MPa H2 and almost no FA can be detected in the product.

This study has prepared a series of supported Pd catalysts and tested them in a flow reactor. Synthesized catalysts were studied by low-temperature nitrogen adsorption, temperature programmed reduction, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. Catalysts supported on mesoporous silicas MCM-48 and SBA-15 exhibit higher activity than catalysts on amorphous SiO2. The catalyst activities seemed to be primarily related to the particle size and dispersion of palladium. MCM-48 and SBA-15 make it possible to obtain smaller palladium particles that exhibit higher activity in the dehydrogenation reaction of decalin. Kinetic parameters for the dehydrogenation of decalin over the various Pd catalysts were obtained to determine the release of the hydrogen. The studied palladium catalysts supported on MCM-48 and SBA-15 can be recommended as potential catalysts for hydrogenation/dehydrogenation of aromatic compounds considered as liquid organic hydrogen carriers.",

Diagnostic methods/biosensors having a high limit of detection are often modified by the incorporation of nanoparticles. Nanoparticles are also known to enhance enzymatic activity. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of ions and nanoparticles of gold and silver on the catalysis of ALP and hence on the detection potential of ELISA. The nanoparticles were synthesized using citrate as a stabilizing and reducing agent. Both nanoparticles and ions bound ALP conjugated to goat anti-rabbit IgG as shown by UV-visible and fluorescence spectroscopic analysis. Maximum detection signal was achieved when ELISA was conducted in the presence of a combination of 0.8 \u00b5g/ml cit-AuNPs and 700 nM AgCl. The increase was by 2.65 and 3.67 folds when the combination was introduced at the substrate step and at the secondary antibody step, respectively. Molecular docking revealed that citrate binds to specific residues close to the substrate binding site leading to catalytically favoured structural changes in the conformation of ALP. The study provides a promising approach to modulate enzyme-associated diagnostic and therapeutic processes using ions and nanoparticles.",

Combing the characterizations and DFT calculations, the satisfying catalytic performance could be attributed to two aspects: (i) the unrestricted mass transfer of reactant and the high dispersity of Pd were simultaneously ensured in the straight micrometer-channel with abundant surface anchoring groups of poplar wood; (ii) the nano-thick graphited carbon layer on Pd significantly enhanced the oxygen activation. Given the low cost of economic wood and facile preparation technique, this work opened up new alternative for the preparation of highly dispersed noble metal catalyst and the low temperature catalytic combustion of aromatic VOCs in industry.",

Several Mn\u2013Ce/AC catalysts prepared and then poisoned by SO2 were used in the study. The physicochemical properties of the catalysts were systematically characterized before and after poisoning, and the mechanism of SO2 poisoning was proposed. SO2 poisoning considerably affects the Mn\u2013Ce/AC catalyst, decreasing its denitration rate from 98% to 47.9% and N2 selectivity from 96% to 85%. This can be attributed to several phenomena. SO2 poisoning increases the surface roughness of the catalyst and results in the formation of Mn(SO4)2, other sulfates, and other substances, which block the catalyst pores and reduce the content of the C and O elements on the catalyst surface as well as its specific surface area, consequently decreasing the adsorption area available for the reaction gas. Moreover, the crystallinity of MnOx on the surface of the catalyst increases, decreasing the contents of Mn4+, Ce4+ and chemosorbed oxygen. In addition, the surface functional groups, such as \u2013COOH, \u2013OH, and C=O, are destroyed, reducing the adsorption sites of the reaction gas and the adsorption capacity of the catalyst, consequently inhibiting the SCR reaction. Ce can reduce the effects of SO2 poisoning on the catalyst because Ce4+ can improve its oxygen storage capacity, increase the adsorption sites for the reaction gas, and react with SO2, preventing sulfate formation and pore blockage. However, excessive Ce loading causes metal agglomeration on the catalyst surface, reducing its denitration efficiency.",
